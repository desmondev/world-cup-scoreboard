# World Cup Scoreboard

## Assumptions

It's a simple library to show the current score of the World Cup games.

The scoreboard supports the following operations:
1. Start a new game, assuming initial score 0 – 0 and adding it the scoreboard.
   This should capture following parameters:
   a. Home team
   b. Away team
2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away
   team score.
3. Finish game currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
4. Get a summary of games in progress ordered by their total score. The games with the same
   total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the scoreboard.


## Example
For example, if following matches are started in the specified order and their scores
respectively updated:
a. Mexico 0 - Canada 5
b. Spain 10 - Brazil 2
c. Germany 2 - France 2
d. Uruguay 6 - Italy 6
e. Argentina 3 - Australia 1

The summary should be as follows:
1. Uruguay 6 - Italy 6
2. Spain 10 - Brazil 2
3. Mexico 0 - Canada 5
4. Argentina 3 - Australia 1
5. Germany 2 - France 2
